# Spectral Tokenization Design

Authoritative note:

`wip/master-plan.md` now governs the active wordification, quantization,
and output-contract plan. This file remains a design reference for the
tokenization problem space. When they conflict, the master plan wins.

This document defines how continuous spectral measurements can become the
discrete documents required by Latent Dirichlet Allocation and related
topic models.

## Purpose

The tokenizer is the scientific bottleneck of the product. A topic model
cannot recover physical structure that was destroyed before the model saw
the data. Tokenization must therefore preserve enough spectral, spatial,
and acquisition context while still producing a compact vocabulary.

The product reset treats tokenization as a first-class workflow step.
Users must see the selected alphabet, word definition, document
definition, corpus size, vocabulary size, and caveats before PTM/LDA
topics are displayed.

## Data Model

The canonical internal objects should be:

- `Scene`: one HSI/MSI cube or external patch collection.
- `Sample`: a logical subset of a scene, such as a point, patch, ROI,
  class region, mineral sample, or UAV field tile.
- `Spectrum`: one vector of band responses.
- `Document`: one tokenized object passed to LDA.
- `Word`: one discrete token derived from spectral or spatial evidence.
- `Corpus`: a collection of documents built under one encoding policy.

## Required Metadata

Every tokenizer run should record:

- source dataset ID
- source scene/sample ID
- band count
- wavelength centers when known
- wavelength units
- preprocessing flags
- normalization method
- quantization method
- document geometry
- random seed
- vocabulary version

Without this metadata, topic comparisons across scenes are not reliable.

## Normalization Choices

### Per-Spectrum Scaling

Each spectrum is scaled independently. This emphasizes shape but removes
absolute albedo differences.

Use when:

- comparing shape-dominated material behavior
- illumination varies strongly
- absolute calibration is weak

Risk:

- can erase meaningful brightness differences between materials

### Per-Band Scaling

Each band is scaled across all spectra. This makes bands comparable as
features but can amplify noisy bands.

Use when:

- the scene has stable calibration
- documents are built from many pixels
- the goal is scene-level classification

Risk:

- scene-specific scaling can hurt cross-scene transfer

### Reflectance-Preserving Scaling

Reflectance values are kept in physical units or minimally transformed.

Use when:

- calibrated reflectance is available
- spectral-library alignment is planned
- mineral/clay absorption interpretation matters

Risk:

- requires careful handling of outliers, bad bands, and sensor artifacts

## Quantization Choices

### Uniform Bins

Divide the response range into fixed-width bins.

Strength:

- simple and reproducible

Weakness:

- poor use of vocabulary when data is skewed

### Quantile Bins

Divide values so each bin has similar frequency.

Strength:

- balanced word counts for LDA

Weakness:

- bin meaning becomes scene-dependent and less physically interpretable

### Physically Anchored Bins

Use reflectance or absorption thresholds based on domain knowledge.

Strength:

- interpretable and stable across scenes

Weakness:

- requires calibrated data and careful expert design

## Vocabulary Families

### Current Minimum Vocabulary

The current app can display compact token lists and topic mixtures. This
is enough for an interactive explanation but not enough for a scientific
claim about minerals, wetlands, or satellite transfer.

### Recommended V1 Vocabulary

For each spectrum:

- `b{band}_q{bin}` for band-intensity evidence
- `g{group}_q{bin}` for wavelength-group evidence
- `slope_{group}_{bin}` for coarse shape behavior

For each patch:

- aggregate spectrum tokens
- add patch-level strata such as `ndvi_low`, `ndvi_mid`, `ndvi_high` when
  MSI vegetation indices exist
- add `texture_{bin}` only when the texture metric is documented

### Recommended Mineral Vocabulary

Mineral and clay workflows should add:

- continuum-removed absorption depth bins
- absorption center bins
- absorption width/asymmetry bins
- spectral-region tags for VNIR, SWIR-1, SWIR-2
- explicit bad-band masks

Do not add mineral labels to tokens unless labels are known. A token
should describe measured behavior, not assume interpretation.

### Recommended Satellite Vocabulary

Satellite and broad land-cover workflows should add:

- Sentinel-2 or Landsat band names when calibrated
- vegetation index strata
- water index strata
- bare-soil or built-up index strata when implemented
- seasonal or acquisition-window metadata only if it is reliable

## Document Granularity

Document granularity controls topic semantics.

| Document Type | Best For | Main Risk |
|---|---|---|
| One spectrum | Pixel or point-level demos | No local context |
| Fixed patch | Satellite and UAV patches | Patch size controls topic meaning |
| ROI/class region | Labeled benchmark summaries | Labels can hide within-class variability |
| Sample window | Drill core, lab scans, field plots | Needs reproducible geometry |
| Band group | Mineral absorption analysis | Requires calibrated wavelengths |

## Comparison Experiments

Every serious representation should be compared with:

- vocabulary size
- document length distribution
- topic coherence proxy
- topic stability across random seeds
- class or target separability in topic-mixture space
- qualitative alignment with known spectral behavior
- sensitivity to quantization bin count
- sensitivity to bad-band removal

## Implementation Requirements

The next tokenizer implementation should expose:

- a pure function from spectra and metadata to documents
- a stable JSON schema for generated corpora
- a vocabulary manifest
- a reversible mapping from token IDs to token meaning
- tests for deterministic output under a fixed seed
- size checks for generated assets

## Known Gaps

- Current public app assets do not yet store calibrated band centers for
  every scene.
- Current topic tokens are explanation-oriented, not a final tokenizer.
- Patch-level tokens for wetlands, urban scenes, and satellite data are
  not implemented.
- Absorption-feature tokens for minerals and clays are not implemented.
- Topic stability now has a first automated multi-seed component report
  in the local core, but there is still no full sensitivity layer across
  preprocessing, tokenizers, and scene splits.
