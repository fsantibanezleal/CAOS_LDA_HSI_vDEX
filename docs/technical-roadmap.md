# Technical Roadmap

Authoritative note:

`wip/master-plan.md` now governs methodology, storage tiering, builder
inventory, curation rules, and the web data contract. This roadmap is
retained as reset history plus execution context. When they conflict, the
master plan wins.

This roadmap now treats the repo as a local scientific validation system
with a secondary interactive presentation layer.

## Current Reset Status

Status: active reset in progress.

The deployed SPA is a technical checkpoint only. The accepted direction
is:

1. local acquisition and organization of real spectral data
2. offline representations, segmentation, PTM/LDA, clustering, and
   supervised modeling
3. dense methodological documentation
4. compact interactive export into the web app

## Phase 0: Historical Recovery Baseline

Status: complete.

Delivered historically:

- FastAPI backend serving a React SPA
- public repo and VPS deployment
- bilingual UI and theme support
- compact demo and first derived scene assets

Limitation:

- the UI direction was rejected because it behaved like a confused
  workbench/report hybrid and did not express the real methodological
  flow

## Phase 1: Method Review And Product Reset

Status: first pass delivered, ongoing expansion.

Delivered:

- `docs/product-reset-research.md`
- `data/manifests/data_families.json`
- `data/manifests/corpus_recipes.json`
- `data/manifests/local_validation_matrix.json`
- explicit supervision and acquisition metadata in
  `data/manifests/datasets.json`

Acceptance:

- every product-visible method must state alphabet, word, document,
  corpus, feature space, supervision, and caveat

## Phase 2: Local Data Acquisition And Inventory

Status: first pass delivered.

Delivered:

- reproducible raw acquisition scripts in `data-pipeline/`
- unified local inventory in `data/derived/core/local_dataset_inventory.json`
- local raw evidence currently indexed across UPV/EHU, Borsoi MUA,
  MicaSense, and USGS compact spectral-library archives

Next work:

- reproduce a session-backed ECOSTRESS export path beyond the current
  public metadata manifest
- harden the current HIDSAG `GEOMET` + `MINERAL1` + `MINERAL2` +
  `GEOCHEM` + `PORPHYRY` supervised benchmarks with sensor-aware
  bad-band handling, stronger group-aware split design, and
  wavelength-aware region documents
- reproduce at least one cross-scene transfer dataset
- keep raw-local, git-public, and web-public policies clearly separated

## Phase 3: Representation And Corpus Engine

Status: first pass delivered.

Delivered:

- deterministic corpus previews in
  `data/derived/corpus/corpus_previews.json`
- first-pass recipes for magnitude phrase, band frequency,
  band-magnitude words, and region-style documents
- first compact HIDSAG patch-region export in
  `data/derived/core/hidsag_region_documents.json` +
  `hidsag_region_documents.npz`
- wavelength vectors preserved in the compact HIDSAG subset from raw h5
  metadata
- heuristic HIDSAG band-quality summary in
  `data/derived/core/hidsag_band_quality.json`

Next work:

- absorption/shape vocabularies
- hierarchical documents for measured regions with sensor-aware
  bad-band handling
- stronger token diagnostics and reversibility metadata

## Phase 4: Segmentation, Clustering, And Topic Benchmarks

Status: first pass delivered and now extended.

Delivered:

- SLIC baseline payload in
  `data/derived/baselines/segmentation_baselines.json`
- offline benchmark payload in
  `data/derived/core/local_core_benchmarks.json`
- first-pass LDA runs over real local scenes
- first-pass supervised baselines on labeled scenes, including flat
  topic-feature controls rather than headline PTM claims
- KMeans, GMM, and hierarchical clustering comparisons in raw and
  topic-space views
- first-pass topic-stability diagnostics across multiple seeds
- first-pass SAM-style reference alignment
- first-pass NMF/unmixing comparisons on Borsoi ROIs and Cuprite
  alignment probes

Current limitation:

- semantic segmentation overlays are still planned
- PM-LDA and semi-supervised PM-LDA are still pending
- topic stability is still compact-sample-based and not yet a full
  quantization/document-definition sensitivity study

## Phase 5: Measured-Target Training And Validation

Status: first pass delivered.

Scope:

- regression and classification over measured datasets such as HIDSAG,
  now covering `GEOMET`, `MINERAL1`, `MINERAL2`, `GEOCHEM`, and
  `PORPHYRY`
- topic-routed and hierarchical models
- flat topic-mixture classifiers kept only as controls
- split definitions, model cards, residual/error analysis
- topic stability and sensitivity studies

Delivered:

- first supervised Family D benchmark over `HIDSAG MINERAL1`
- first supervised Family D benchmark over `HIDSAG MINERAL2`
- second supervised Family D benchmark over `HIDSAG GEOMET`
- third supervised Family D benchmark over `HIDSAG GEOCHEM`
- fourth supervised Family D benchmark over `HIDSAG PORPHYRY`
- leave-one-out classification/regression tasks for `MINERAL2`
- five-fold classification/regression tasks for `GEOMET` and `GEOCHEM`
- group-aware process split for `MINERAL1`
- group-aware ore-group split for `PORPHYRY`
- sample-level, cube-aggregated, and patch-region topic-mixture
  comparisons across all five current subsets
- explicit evidence that current Family D topic documents still collapse
  unevenly under the current formulation, even after patch-region
  aggregation
- heuristic bad-band summary and preprocessing-sensitivity benchmark now
  versioned across all five current HIDSAG subsets
- explicit evidence that preprocessing choice can dominate selected
  Family D tasks, especially on `MINERAL2`, `GEOCHEM`, and `PORPHYRY`
- positive `R^2` geochemical regression signal on `GEOCHEM` for routed
  or region-topic variants on targets such as Fe, Ca, S, and Cu
- explicit evidence that stronger split design can invalidate earlier
  optimistic readings, especially on `MINERAL1` and `PORPHYRY`

Next work:

- move from the current grouped CV setup to broader split designs with
  particle-size awareness and repeated-measurement blocking
- replace the current heuristic bad-band policy with sensor-aware masks
  wherever the source metadata permits it
- add model cards and failure-case summaries before any web-facing
  narrative

Acceptance:

- no trained model becomes product-visible without split definition,
  metrics, caveats, and provenance
- flat `theta` classifiers do not count as the canonical PTM result for
  this phase

## Phase 6: Publishable Interactive Subsets

Status: planned.

Scope:

- select only compact, high-value subsets from the local core
- export band metadata, spectral samples, overlays, topic maps, and
  comparison summaries in app-friendly form
- version those subsets independently from raw local archives

Acceptance:

- every exported subset must link back to a validated local workflow
- static screenshots are auxiliary only, never the primary evidence

## Phase 7: Web App Rebuild

Status: blocked on Phase 6 assets, but the target structure is already
defined.

Target product structure:

- `Context` surface for explanation and conceptual framing
- `Workspace` surface with left method scope, central interactive
  evidence, and right inference/validation

Mandatory capabilities:

- interactive spectral plots
- band-selectable image views
- overlay switching for labels, SLIC, topics, clusters, and semantic
  maps where available
- explicit comparison and caveat panels

## Phase 8: Scientific Validation Layer

Status: planned.

Scope:

- repeated fits across seeds
- quantization sensitivity
- document-definition sensitivity
- spectral-library alignment
- label/measurement association
- cross-scene transfer validation

Acceptance:

- the app must distinguish exploratory evidence from validated evidence
- the docs must distinguish demo assets from publishable scientific
  claims

## Immediate Engineering Focus

1. keep growing the local validation core
2. deepen acquisition for real high-value datasets
3. extend offline method comparisons beyond the first SAM/NMF/stability
   layer
4. export only compact subsets with interactive value
5. rebuild the app only after the above is materially in place
